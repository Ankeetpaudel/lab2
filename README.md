Core Components
Base Tower (BaseTower.cs)
This class forms the backbone of the tower system, defining the essential properties and methods used by all towers.
csharp

Implementations:
•	Create specific factory classes for each tower type that encapsulate the creation logic and initial configuration.
Scene Structure
Tower Scene Components
Details the organizational structure of a typical tower scene in Godot.
26.	Root Node (Node2D):

•	Export parameters for configuring the bullet type and tower components.
27.	Sprites:
•	Towerbody (AnimatedSprite2D): Displays the main body of the tower.
•	Towerhead (AnimatedSprite2D): Visualizes the part of the tower that rotates and aims.
•	Cow indicator (Sprite2D): A simple visual indicator used for debugging or thematic elements.
28.	Collision Areas:
•	Sight (Area2D): Defines the detection zone for enemy targets.
•	Placement (Area2D): Manages valid placement zones to ensure towers are positioned logically.
29.	Timer:
•	Manages the shooting intervals, ensuring towers fire at consistent rates according to their specifications.
